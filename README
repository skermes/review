Simple code review tool; runs diffs against git branches.

Configuration:
You will need to set the following variables in config.rb in the same directory as review.rb:
# site-specific configuration
# path to git repo
REPO = 'c:\\users\\skermes\\projects\\css'
# if true, all diffs will be done on remote branches
REMOTE_BRANCHES = false
# the name of the remote branch to use
# this only matters if REMOTE_BRANCHES is true
REMOTE_NAME = 'origin'


Here's what you'll need to work on this:
sinatra (1.3.1)
haml (3.1.3)
ruby-1.9.2-p0

Those will require the following gems:
activemodel (3.0.3)
activesupport (3.0.3)
builder (2.1.2)
i18n (0.4.2)
rack (1.3.5)
rack-protection (1.1.4)
