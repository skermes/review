Simple code review tool; runs diffs against git branches.

Configuration:
The settings are stored in config.json.  It looks like this:
{ "repositories" : [ ... ] }

You will need to define at least one repository.
A repository looks like this:
{ "name" : "my_repository",
  "location" : "path/to/repo",
  "use_remote" : true,
  "remote_name" : "origin"
}

The name property will be used in URLs, so use something that
browsers won't try to escape.  If use_remote is false, remote_name
can be safely omitted.

Here's what you'll need to work on this:
sinatra (1.3.1)
haml (3.1.3)
ruby 1.9.3p125

Those will require the following gems:
activemodel (3.0.3)
activesupport (3.0.3)
builder (2.1.2)
i18n (0.4.2)
rack (1.3.5)
rack-protection (1.1.4)
tilt (1.3.3)
